# FlappyStallion
This is a game.

Friday, Feb. 9th.==> We met at 1.30 and it took around an hour. We discussed about our roles in the team. However, we could not specify exact roles for each of us because we are still working on what kind of responsibilities we have in the project.

Friday, Feb. 16th==> We met at 1.40 and the meeting took 1 hour. A couple member stayed longer to discuss further. We need to check other game tutorial videos to make sure we are not wasting our time. Maybe other languages or platforms such as C# and Unity

Tuesday, Feb. 20th==> We doubled our meetings, and this was our first meeting on a Tuesday. Talked about Understanding Requirements.

Friday, Feb. 23rd==> Meeting took place at 2pm. Lasted 30 minutes. It was a brief one because two of the members were not able to come. We decided discussing use case diagram over the phone; text and calls.
